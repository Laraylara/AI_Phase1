# Introduction
In this project, we predict house prices based on a dataset of house features. We start by preparing the dataset, performing data preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

# Installation and Dependencies
To run this project in Google Colaboratory, you will need the following dependencies:
1.Python 3.x
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost 
4.Google Colaboratory account

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "USA Housing" dataset. It contains various features that can be used to predict house prices. The dataset includes the following columns:
Avg. Area Income: Average income of residents in the area.
Avg. Area House Age: Average age of houses in the area.
Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Average number of rooms in houses in the area.
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Average number of bedrooms in houses in the area.
Area Population: Population of the area.
Price: The price of the house.
Address: Address of the house.

# How to Use
1.Clone this repository to your Google Colaboratory environment.
2.Upload the dataset file(USA_Housing.csv)downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing  to your Colab environment or specify the dataset path.
3.Open the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook and run the cells sequentially.
4.Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to build and evaluate your house price prediction model.

# Model
The machine learning model used for house price prediction is  XGBoost regression model. You can explore and experiment with different models for better accuracy.

# Results
After running the notebook, you will obtain house price predictions and can evaluate the model's performance.
